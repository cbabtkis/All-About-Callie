        <p><em>First Time Web Designer, <strong><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/admirers">Long Time Admirer</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I have dabbled in many different kinds of work. I began at a Co-op cafe as a
          barista, where I moved into office and produce managment. I began working at
          a pub, where I served as well as handled inventory, supplier relations, and
          booking of entertainment events. During this time, I lived on multiple goat
          farms, where I learned milking, handling, and cheese making.

  <h3>Adventures and Injuries</h3>
  <p>I enjoy roaming around, seeing different states and countries. This has led
    me to many wonderful experiences, such as making it to the amazing National
    Parks in Washington and Oregon, hiking through Trinity and Yosemite, and
    surviving a five week trip around Europe by myself. The adventure driven
    side of me has also caused some more dangerous adventures and injuries, such
    as getting lost on the five week Europe trip, getting roofied at a Pirate
    Festival in Oregon, getting stranded on top of a deserted mountain in
    Washington, and losing the use of my ankle in the middle of the woods
    multiple times.
